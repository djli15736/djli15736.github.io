# Portfolio
<strong> Week 1 </strong>
<ul>
  <li> I went through the html and css basic tutorials on <a href = "https://htmldog.com/guides/"> htmldog.com. </a> Used the tutorial to make <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/myfirstwebpage-portfolio-daniel/myfirstpage.html"> this </a> webpage using html and css and become somewhat proficient in those skills. </li>
  <li> Did some additional html and css stuff in one of my classes. I experimented a bit more with both of them in <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/vYOrKdo"> this </a> codepen. </li>
  <li> I went through the <a href = "https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html"> React </a> and <a href = "https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html"> Hooks </a> tutorials and made the Tic Tac Toe game that came with the React tutorial <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/VwWPaMM"> here. </a> </li>
  <li> I used JavaScript to make a very basic button that just counts how many times you've clicked on it <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/powRVwL"> here. </a> </li>
</ul>

<strong> Week 2 </strong>
<ul>
  <li> I went through the JavaScript tutorials on htmldog <a href = "https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/"> here </a> and did both the beginner and intermediate versions. It wasn't too difficult overall, but it helped with refreshing my mind on basic JavaScript syntax and how JavaScript connects to html and css. </li>
  <li> I went through <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/"> this </a> bootstrap tutorial and experimented with some of the basic stuff like containers, grids, typography, and styling. I made <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/bootstrapstuff.github.io/"> this </a> website that shows what I experimented with. </li>
  <li> I made a pretty basic stopwatch using JavaScript and html <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/abwEQLQ"> here </a>. Making the buttons and the click listener wasn't too difficult, but the hard part was actually making the timer count up. That took some math and I had to make it keep going with only one click. </li>
  <li> I also made <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/basicchatapp2.github.io/"> this </a> chat app. You type in your name, and then if you type in messages and send them, it will show that you were the one who sent the message. I tried to incorporate some of the css and bootstrap I learned by centering the text and putting things in containers. The functionality was also different from the basic button and the stopwatch because I had to handle inputs and figure out how to append them to a list and have the list grow with each message sent. I tried to have a button next to the name input and have the app save who you were, but I didn't end up figuring that out in the end. Also, this was the first app I did where I only committed using git and not directly editing the text. </li>
  <li> I tried to make a React app like the one we did in class. I used a lot of components to do things like display pictures, text, and lists. I also used useState to have a clickable button that cycled through quotes, similar to the prompt button we did in class. I then spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the website deployed. I debugged a lot and made a whole bunch of commits trying to figure things out, but so far I haven't managed to do it yet. <a href = "https://github.com/djli15736/bobbybreacts.github.io"> Here's </a> the repository of what I've tried though. </li>
<ul>

<strong> Week 3 </strong>
<ul>
  <li> I watched the entire ta-trainer video. </li>
  <li> I followed along with the ta-trainer video and coded my own version of it. Instead of using cards, it displays quotes from Game of Thrones. <a href = "https://github.com/djli15736/quote-game"> this </a> is the repository for it and <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/quote-game/"> this </a> is the link to the actual website. In order to display the understanding I gained from the video, I added a way to "play" the game and score yourself. To do this, I added an input box that you can type into to guess who said the displayed quote and a button to submit your guess. I also added a div that displayed your score, and I had difficulty trying to get the score to update for each click. My first problem was that the score would reset every time I changed quotes, so I realized that I needed to use a state. I then added the consts score and setScore that would be triggered based on the button click, and that finally got the scoring to work properly. I also tried adding the ability to display "Correct!" and "Incorrect!" on the screen based on whether you got the answer correct or incorrect. I tried to use states for this, but ultimately couldn't figure it out so I just used alerts. However, I still feel like I learned a lot from messing around with states without relying on guidance from the video. Additionally, I deployed my React app properly this time, so I didn't feel the need to go back to my other React app and deploy it</li>
  <li> I also made a bunch of unit tests for the ta-trainer <a href = "https://github.com/djli15736/ta-trainer"> here </a>. I tested for things like whether the modal appeared when you clicked on the add new card button, whether the prompt and answer text is in the modal when you open it, and whether the modal closes when you click save changes. I tried to do test for whether saving in the modal actually saves by trying to mess around with the display, but I couldn't quite figure out how to do that. Ultimately, I still feel like I learned a lot from doing the tests because it forced me to follow the flow of data and really understand how the Components interacted with each other. </li>
  <li> This time I only used git to make any changes and commits to my portfolio! </li>
</ul>

# TODO
<strong> Week 1 </strong> 
<ul> 
  <li> Do the JavaScript tutorials on htmldog to get better at JS </li>
  <li> Make a timer/stopwatch? </li>
  <li> Practing more using git with the <a href = "https://learngitbranching.js.org/"> tutorials. </a> </li> Also demonstrate more git knowledge by making commits from the command line, using branches, etc. 
  <li> Learn bootstrap using the provided <a href = "https://sun.iwu.edu/~mliffito/cs_codex/posts/bootstrap/"> tutorials. </a> </li>
  <li> Maybe make a choose your own adventure as a cool app </li>
</ul>

<strong> Week 2 </strong>
<ul> 
  <li> Finish deploying my React app </li>
  <li> Work on a choose your own adventure since I didn't get to do it last week </li>
  <li> Try to improve my React skills by making more complicated components and maybe using hooks like useEffect </li>
  <li> Do stuff with git beyond just commiting and pushing. I never got to the tutorials <a href = "https://learngitbranching.js.org/"> here </a>. 
</ul>

<strong> Week 3 </strong>
<ul> 
  <li> Tune up my quotes-game and add some more functionality, such as giving users an individual score </li>
  <li> Try to actually make a choose your own adventure using React. I'll try to make it in a similar way as the quote-app and ta-trainer. I expect this to take up most of the time </li>
</ul>
