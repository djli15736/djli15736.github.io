# Portfolio
<strong> Week 1 </strong>
<ul>
  <li> I went through the html and css basic tutorials on <a href = "https://htmldog.com/guides/"> htmldog.com. </a> Used the tutorial to make <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/myfirstwebpage-portfolio-daniel/myfirstpage.html"> this </a> webpage using html and css and become somewhat proficient in those skills. </li>
  <li> Did some additional html and css stuff in one of my classes. I experimented a bit more with both of them in <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/vYOrKdo"> this </a> codepen. </li>
  <li> I went through the <a href = "https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html"> React </a> and <a href = "https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html"> Hooks </a> tutorials and made the Tic Tac Toe game that came with the React tutorial <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/VwWPaMM"> here. </a> </li>
  <li> I used JavaScript to make a very basic button that just counts how many times you've clicked on it <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/powRVwL"> here. </a> </li>
</ul>

<strong> Week 2 </strong>
<ul>
  <li> I went through the JavaScript tutorials on htmldog <a href = "https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/"> here </a> and did both the beginner and intermediate versions. It wasn't too difficult overall, but it helped with refreshing my mind on basic JavaScript syntax and how JavaScript connects to html and css. </li>
  <li> I went through <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/"> this </a> bootstrap tutorial and experimented with some of the basic stuff like containers, grids, typography, and styling. I made <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/bootstrapstuff.github.io/"> this </a> website that shows what I experimented with. </li>
  <li> I made a pretty basic stopwatch using JavaScript and html <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/abwEQLQ"> here </a>. Making the buttons and the click listener wasn't too difficult, but the hard part was actually making the timer count up. That took some math and I had to make it keep going with only one click. </li>
  <li> I also made <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/basicchatapp2.github.io/"> this </a> chat app. You type in your name, and then if you type in messages and send them, it will show that you were the one who sent the message. I tried to incorporate some of the css and bootstrap I learned by centering the text and putting things in containers. The functionality was also different from the basic button and the stopwatch because I had to handle inputs and figure out how to append them to a list and have the list grow with each message sent. I tried to have a button next to the name input and have the app save who you were, but I didn't end up figuring that out in the end. Also, this was the first app I did where I only committed using git and not directly editing the text. </li>
  <li> I tried to make a React app like the one we did in class. I used a lot of components to do things like display pictures, text, and lists. I also used useState to have a clickable button that cycled through quotes, similar to the prompt button we did in class. I then spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the website deployed. I debugged a lot and made a whole bunch of commits trying to figure things out, but so far I haven't managed to do it yet. <a href = "https://github.com/djli15736/bobbybreacts.github.io"> Here's </a> the repository of what I've tried though. </li>
</ul>
