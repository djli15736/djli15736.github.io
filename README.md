# Portfolio
<strong> Week 1 </strong>
<ul>
  <li> I went through the html and css basic tutorials on <a href = "https://htmldog.com/guides/"> htmldog.com. </a> Used the tutorial to make <a href = "https://djli15736.github.io/myfirstwebpage-portfolio-daniel/myfirstpage.html"> this </a> webpage using html and css and become somewhat proficient in those skills. </li>
  <li> Did some additional html and css stuff in one of my classes. I experimented a bit more with both of them in <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/vYOrKdo"> this </a> codepen. </li>
  <li> I went through the <a href = "https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html"> React </a> and <a href = "https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html"> Hooks </a> tutorials and made the Tic Tac Toe game that came with the React tutorial <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/VwWPaMM"> here. </a> </li>
  <li> I used JavaScript to make a very basic button that just counts how many times you've clicked on it <a href = "https://codepen.io/djli/pen/powRVwL"> here. </a> </li>
